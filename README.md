### Author: Alex Korir
#### The project was fully created by Alex Korir but also codemates made a really big contribution towards its success.
##### The project is about a triangle tracker where a user enters the 3 sides of a triangle using JavaScript prompt box. After entering all the three sides of a triangle, the user gets the following results using the alert box.
> Equilateral: All the sides are equal.
> isoceles: Exactly 2 sides are equal.
> Scalene: No sides are equal.
> Not a triangle. The sum of the length of any two sides of a triangle is less than or equal to the length of the third side.
the project has used Html for writting the main content, css for styling the website and JavaScript for prompting and calculating the anwser
o##### Open the website at https://alexarirok.github.io/Triangle--Tracker/ then a box will prompt you to enter a value of a triangle. When entered the same number three times, an alert box will appear showing equilateral. When you enter 2 same numbers and one diffrently, the alert box will write isoceles. when you enter 3 diffrent numbers it will alert you as scalene. when you enter the sum of the two lengths to be the third number it will prompt you not a traingle.
